# Discord-OpenAI Grammar Fixer
This project uses the OpenAI API to make a simple request (a request to fix the grammar of a Discord message) retrieved from a user via the Discord bot.<br/><br/> In order to use this repository yourself, you will need your own OpenAI API key and your own Discord application. Once the scripts are up and running, a user simply needs to reply to the message that needs fixing with the keyword: 
 >   '!fixthis'
>
Assuming that the bot has sufficient permissions, a fixed message will be sent.
